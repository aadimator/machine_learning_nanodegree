    "### 1. Support Vector Machines\n",
    "- General Applications: Highly competitive performance in numerous real-world applications, such as bioinformatics, text mining, face recognition, and image processing.\n",
    "- Strengths: SVM is very effective in high-dimensional spaces, and in situations when we have a non-linear separation problem. With SVM, we have the possibility to apply new kernels which increases the flexibility for our decision boundaries, leading to a better classification performance.\n",
    "- Weaknesses: One major disadvantage of the SVM is the choice of the kernel and also it is somewhat slower as compared to some other models like Decision trees or Naive bayes.\n",
    "- Why I chose this model: I chose this model because we are working with a small number of data samples and SVMs work well with small data sets and applying different kernels provide flexibility for our decision boundaries thus leading to a better classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Decision Trees\n",
    "- General Applications: Decision trees have been widely used in the field of medical research and practice. Recent uses of automatic induction of decision trees can be found in diagnosis, cardiology, psychiatry, gastroenterology, for detecting microcalcifications in mammography, to analyze Sudden Infant Death(SID) syndrome and for diagnosing thyroid disorders.\n",
    "- Strengths: The advantages of a decision trees are that nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect our performance metrics and they give us faster prediction as compared to some other models like SVMs.\n",
    "- Weaknesses: They do not work well if we have smooth boundaries. i.e they work best when we have discontinuous piece wise constant model. If we truly have a linear target function, decision trees are not the best.\n",
    "- Why I chose this model: I chose this model because the decision tree provides a good performance metric for non-linear data. So, if our student data turns out to be non-linear, then decision trees would prove to be a better option.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Naive Bayes\n",
    "- General Applications: Naive Bayes methods can be used to mark an email as spam or not spam, to check a piece of text expressing positive emotions, or negative emotions and also in face recognition softwares.\n",
    "- Strengths: The advantages of naive bayes is that a NB classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models like logistic regression, so we need less training data.\n",
    "- Weaknesses: The same conditional independence assumption can be a disadvantage when we have no occurrences of a class label and a feature value together, what will give us a zero frequency-based value probability that affects any posterior probability estimate.\n",
    "- Why I chose this model: I chose this model because if the NB conditional independence assumption actually holds, the Naive Bayes classifier will converge quicker than discriminative models like logistic regression, so we'll need less training data which is in accordance with the number of data samples given to us."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    "**Answer: ** The model chosen to classify students likely to suffer intervention or not, is the Support Vector Machines(SVMs). The model uses the data from the previous students (age, sex, family, etc.) to make predictions on the new students' data. We can understand the working of SVMs as let's suppose we try to fit a sheet of paper in between two clouds of points, the margin could then be described as us trying to place this sheet of paper as dead center between the two clouds of points as possible (so as to avoid touching either cloud).Also we can use different kernel trick(to deal with non-linearity) which can be described as the similarity measure by which we determine whether two points are close or far.So,this model will undergo a training process with the data of these students and will create a margin between a set of students who failed and those who managed to pass.After establishing this margin that separates our class well for the model, we introduce the model to the new data from the newly arrived students. So, the model will be able to predict depending on the side of the margin the student falls if he or she would pass or not."
