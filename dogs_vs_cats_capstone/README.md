You can acquire the dataset for this project from here:

I'm using Keras library and Theano as the backend.  

As I'm taking the deep learning course provided by **Fast.ai**, that's why some of my methodologies and techniques are inspired from there and I'm also using the Vgg16.py library that they provided. You can find the link to that libraray [here](https://github.com/fastai/courses/blob/master/deeplearning1/nbs/vgg16.py).  
It is basically the same class/functionality that Keras provides but here, we are loading the weights that have been precalculated for us based on the Imagenet dataset.
